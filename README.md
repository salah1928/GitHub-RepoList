# GitHub Top Repos App - oldy but goldy

## About this project

hi gemography (formerly united remote)
This is a small webapp that lists the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days.
To create this app i used vuejs, simply because i'm more familiar with it, and axios, and moment, i used those libraries because they're simple and easy to use.
